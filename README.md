As a course candidate:

I should be able to see all of the courses on offer at 

=> courses index

I should be able to click to register on a course I am interested in:

Once I click register:

I will fill in my name email and mobile
and maybe password (need to think about this). Making users have a way to log uniquely means that we can identify who has filled in the feedback form etc. It would also allow for a "my courses" feature /view. 

This will register me on the course I clicked on.

If the course is full the register link will change to an add me to the waiting list link.

I will be asked for my name email mobile and will be added to the waiting list for that course.

The only other link I will see on the course index page is show. If this is clicked I will get more details about the course.


As an adminstrator:

at courses index 

I will be able to create new courses.

When I click show I will also see a list of participants registered on the course with their current status alongside them e.g. paid, feedback complete etc.

I will be able to move or toggle particpants status from waiting list to registered. 

I will be able to email all candiates registered on a course. 

Only admins will have access to the users view
